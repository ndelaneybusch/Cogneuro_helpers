<h1> Welcome! </h1>
  
This is a resource for cognitive neuroscientists looking for tidbits of code to solve everyday tasks and make things a little easier. With increasing interest in more expansive statistical approaches to analyzing EEG/ERP data, you will also find a few more involved tutorials, and links to the external resources I have found the most helpful.  
  
Below is the site directory. A good starting point is the <a href="https://ndelaneybusch.github.io/Cogneuro_helpers/toolbox/">Data Science Toolbox page</a>, which contains my recommendations for programs and libraries etc and will ensure that you will be able to run every piece of code you find on this website.
