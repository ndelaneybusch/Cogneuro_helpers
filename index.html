<h1> Welcome! </h1>
  
<p>This is a resource for cognitive neuroscientists looking for tidbits of code to solve everyday tasks and make things a little easier. With increasing interest in more expansive statistical approaches to analyzing EEG/ERP data, you will also find a few more involved tutorials, and links to the external resources I have found the most helpful.</p>
<p>Below is the site directory. A good starting point is the <a href="https://ndelaneybusch.github.io/Cogneuro_helpers/toolbox/">Data Science Toolbox page</a>, which contains my recommendations for programs and libraries etc and will ensure that you will be able to run every piece of code you find on this website.</p>

<h1>Visualization</h1><br/>
R: <a href="https://ndelaneybusch.github.io/Cogneuro_helpers/visualizations/vardist/">Distribution plots</a> for continuous variables.
