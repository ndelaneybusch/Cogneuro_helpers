# Philosophy  
I try to follow a simple set of guidelines when approaching my workflow.
 - _Use the right tool for the job._ R is wonderful, but if all I need is a simple chi-squared test, I'm going to use jamovi. If I need to do some heavy scripting to assign stimuli to lists, I'm going to use python. If there's a toolbox that does what I need to do in Matlab, I'm going to use Matlab. Comfort shouldn't dictate the approach.  
 - _Make good habits easy._ Take the time to arrange my workstation so that the things I know I "should" do are easy and salient.
 - _Make it modular._ I re-use code all the time, because I work with similar datasets that pose similar problems. I also want it to be easy to swap out some process with some other process mid-stream (e.g. switch my outlier detection method).
 - _Make it reproducible._ Script everything, use version control, make regular backups, keep it organized, write documentation, comment your code, and make all of these habits easy.
 - _Make it accessible._ Where possible, use free tools, support open-source projects, share data and materials, and host non-paywalled author versions of manuscripts.
